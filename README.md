# **Currency Utilities**

![CI Build](https://github.com/NishantChauhan/CurrencyUtilities/workflows/Continuous-Integration/badge.svg?branch=develop)

 There are many sites to get daily conversion rates. None of them catered to my specific requirements. Hence, I developed this app to get conversion rates that I need at click of a button. The app uses [Foreign exchange rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) for daily exchanges rates based on rates provided by [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html)

## **Features**

1. Home page has currency convertor card preloaded with CAD to INR currency loaded with 1 as default source amount
2. You can toggle 'From' and 'To' currencies easily. The amounts swap themselves when currencies are swapped toggled.
